So is every second spent\nwaiting for the build system to actually start compiling code</p>\n<p>The version provided by Ubuntu 18.04 (i.e. 0.45) is too old to manage properly\nthe dependencies declared by the project.\nSince Meson is a python script, this is quite easy to install the latest\navailable version.</p>\n<pre><code>$ pip3 install meson\n$ meson --version\n0.60.1\n$ sudo apt install ninja-build\n</code></pre>\n<p>To help Meson find the boost library, the following environment variables must\nbe declared.\nThe 2 following <em>exports</em> have been defined in the shell RC file and are thus\nautomatically set in the console.</p>\n<pre><code>export BOOST_INCLUDEDIR=/usr/include/boost\nexport BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=/usr/lib\n</code></pre>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
